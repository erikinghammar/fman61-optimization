A penalty function is a way to reduce the complexity of computing the
solutions to an optimization problem by converting a bounded problem to
an unbounded problem where we penalize input values which are outside
our region of interest.

Common functions include the using the a maximum of function values, the
absolute values of inputs, or squares of these.

We add the penalty function multiplied by a parameter mu to the function
we are optimizing over. 

\(
        \phi = f(\vec(x)) + \mu \rho(\vec(x))
\)

Solving the problem then is the result of searching over increasingly
larger values of \mu. This will penalise more points harsher and
eventually result in the finding of a minimum  which solve the
optimization problem.
